# ~/.vim

In my time using Vim, I switched between MacVim, regular Vim and NeoVim, project drawers and fuzzy file finding, Janus and custom configurations, and so on. My current configuration is a result of that journey which tries to stay light on plugins and key mapping, while still providing a somewhat modern editor configuration.

My [`.vimrc` file](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/.vim/blob/main/.vimrc) is extracted from this document<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>, meaning both should remain in sync. Unless I'm experimenting with something locally that I haven't pushed yet, this document describes the configuration I'm currently using in my editor.

## NeoVim

Recent versions of Vim caught up to most features NeoVim introduced, like true color support, background jobs and the inline terminal. However, NeoVim comes with [sensible defaults](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/2676) out of the box by implementing most of [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible) by default.

As a good starting point, either install both Vim and vim-sensible, or NeoVim. This configuration chooses the latter.


<a id="installation"></a>

### Installation

```shell
brew install neovim
```

```shell
nvim --version | head -n1
```

    NVIM v0.5.0


<a id="setup"></a>

### Setup

Vim and NeoVim use different locations for the configuration file and home directory. This configuration is checked out in Vim's default home directory, which contains the configuration file:

|                    | home directory   | configuration file        |
|------------------ |---------------- |------------------------- |
| Vim                | `~/.vim`         | `~/.vimrc`                |
| NeoVim             | `~/.config/nvim` | `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` |
| This configuration | `~/.vim`         | `~/.vim/.vimrc`           |

To use this configuration, check it out to Vim's home directory path:

```shell
git checkout git@github.com:jeffkreeftmeijer/.vim.git ~/.vim
```

To support NeoVim, symlink NeoVim's home directory and configuration file paths to Vim's:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.config/
ln -s ~/.vim ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```


<a id="package-management"></a>

## Package management

Vim 8 and NeoVim have a native package manager, which loads plugins from the `~/.vim/pack/plugins/start` directory<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>. To install a package, clone its repository into `~/.vim/pack/plugins/start`:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:tpope/vim-commentary.git \
  ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-commentary
```

When publishing dotfiles to a repository for reuse, it's convenient to use Git submodules instead of regular checkouts. This allows for checking the dependencies into version control. Instead of cloning, add a plugin as a submodule:

```shell
git submodule add git@github.com:tpope/vim-commentary.git \
  ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-commentary
```

Another option for installing plugins is using a plugin manager like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Instead of using Git checkouts or submodules, vim-plug handles the installing and updating of plugins.

The plugins themselves are configured through a list of calls to the `Plug` function in the `~/.vimrc` file:

```vimrc
Plug 'tpope/vim-commentary'
```

This configuration uses the latter in an attempt to contain most of the configuration in a single file.


<a id="vim-plug"></a>

### Vim-plug

[Vim-plug's documentation](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#vim) mentions installing the plugin into the autoload directory directly by running a script that downloads `plug.org` to the `~/.vim/autoload` directory:

```shell
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

Instead, to have Vim install vim-plug on startup (again, to contain the configuration to a single file), this snippet automatically downloads `plug.vim` from its repository if it doesn't exist yet:

```vimrc
" Download plug.vim if it doesn't exist yet
if empty(glob('~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim'))
  silent !curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs
    \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
endif
```

Normally, plugins are installed when calling `:PlugInstall` from within Vim. To remove an extra step from the setup, this configuration runs a script on startup that checks for missing packages on startup and install them if needed:

```vimrc
" Run PlugInstall if there are missing plugins
autocmd VimEnter * if len(filter(values(g:plugs), '!isdirectory(v:val.dir)'))
  \| PlugInstall --sync | source ~/.vimrc
\| endif
```

All other plugins are installed through vim-plug.


<a id="installing-packages"></a>

### Installing packages

To install plugins with vim-plug, call the `Plug` function inside the plug-block:

```vimrc
call plug#begin("~/.vim/plugged")

" TODO Add plugins

call plug#end()
```

The `plug#begin("~/.vim/plugged")` function sets up the plugin directory<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> and the `plug#end()` function initializes the plugin system.

To install a plugin, call the `Plug` function *inside* the plug-block with an URL to a git repository:

```vimrc
Plug 'tpope/vim-commentary'
```

The `user/repository` assumes the plugin is hosted on GitHub.


<a id="clipboard"></a>

## Clipboard

Vim uses the "unnamed" register as the clipboard when copying or deleting text from a buffer. To use the system clipboard, prefix the copy or delete command with `"*`. For example, to copy the current line to the system clipboard, use `"*yy`.

To always use the system clipboard, append `unnamedplus` to the `clipboard` setting:

```vimrc
" Always use the system clipboard
set clipboard+=unnamedplus
```

With this setting, `yy` copies the current line to the system clipboard, without needing to add the `"*` prefix.


<a id="packages"></a>

## Packages

This configuration consists of nine packages installed with vim-plug and configuration for some of the packages. The vim-plug plugin block lists all nine:

```vimrc
call plug#begin("~/.vim/plugged")
Plug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'
Plug 'jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-dim'
Plug 'jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-nightfall'
Plug 'jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle'
Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'
Plug 'tpope/vim-commentary'
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
call plug#end()
```

The rest of this section lists each plugin and describes its configuration.


<a id="polyglot"></a>

### Polyglot

[Polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot) is a curated and frequently updated list [list of more than 600 language packs](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot#language-packs)<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> to auto-load syntax highlighting and indentation rules. Although the packs are downloaded on install, they're loaded on demand, so using Polyglot does not affect Vim's startup time.

```vimrc
Plug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'
```


<a id="dim"></a>

### Dim

Vim's default color scheme uses hardcoded color values (comments and some keywords are light blue, for example) that ignore the terminal's set ANSI colors. [Dim](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-dim) is a clone of Vim's default colorscheme, with some improvements. It only uses ANSI colors, so specific color values are [configured in the terminal emulator](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/vim-16-color) instead of in Vim itself.

Dim's syntax highlighting is consistent to prevent color shifts between dark and light backgrounds. It also makes sure to use *dimmed* colors for comments and other non-code elements, to help distinguishing code from everything else.

```vimrc
Plug 'jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-dim'
```

After installing Dim, use it as the default colorscheme by setting `colorscheme` in `~/.vimrc`:

```vimrc
" Use Dim as the default color scheme
colorscheme dim
```


<a id="nightfall"></a>

### Nightfall

[Nightfall](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-nightfall) automatically switches Vim's `bg` between "dark" and "light" based on macOS's dark mode.

```vimrc
Plug 'jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-nightfall'
```


<a id="surround-and-commentary"></a>

### Surround.vim and commentary.vim

[Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope)'s plugins are a staple of most Vim configurations. This configuration includes Tim's [surround.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) and [commentary.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary) for working with surroundings and comments.

The former enables `s`, allowing for `ci"` to replace the contents of a double-quoted string, among many [other examples](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround#readme).

The latter adds quick commenting. Press `gcc` to comment out a line and `gc` to comment out a selection.

```vimrc
Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'
Plug 'tpope/vim-commentary'
```


<a id="vim-numbertoggle"></a>

### Vim-numbertoggle

Vim has [absolute, relative and "hybrid" line numbers](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/vim-number/) to help with locating lines in a file, and moving between files quickly. [Vim-numbertoggle](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle) is a plugin that automatically switches between absolute and hybrid line numbers when switching between normal and insert mode, or when Vim loses focus.

```vimrc
Plug 'jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle'
```

```vimrc
" Turn on line numbers
set number
```


<a id="coc"></a>

### Coc.nvim

[Coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) is a language server plugin to add code completion, inline documentation and compiler checks.

```vimrc
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}
```

After installing Coc.nvim, set `g:coc_global_extensions` to add language server extensions for Elixir, Ruby, Rust, Typescript and VimL:

```vimrc
" Install Coc extensions for Elixir, Ruby, Rust, Typescript and VimL
let g:coc_global_extensions = ['coc-elixir', 'coc-solargraph', 'coc-rls', 'coc-tsserver', 'coc-vimlsp']
```

Automatically format Elixir, Rust and Typescript files on save by setting `g:coc_user_config` instead of using Coc's default JSON configuration file:

```vimrc
" Automatically format Elixir, Rust and Typescript files on save
let g:coc_user_config = {"coc.preferences.formatOnSaveFiletypes": ["elixir", "rust", "typescript"]}
```

Finally, use `<cr>` to select the topmost option during completion:

```vimrc
" Use <cr> to select the first completion
inoremap <silent><expr> <cr> pumvisible() ? coc#_select_confirm() : "\<C-g>u\<CR>"
```


<a id="fzf"></a>

### Fzf.vim

[Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim).vim is a Vim plugin for the fzf command-line fuzzy finder. It provides the `:Files`, `:Buffers` and `:Rg` commands to find and filter files, buffers, and lines, respectively.

```vimrc
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
```

## Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" class="footnum" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Initially, this configuration didn't exist in this form, but I've published my Vim configuration in one way or another since 2010. This document is the current revision.

<sup><a id="fn.2" class="footnum" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> The name of the `start` directory in `~/.vim/pack/plugins/start` can be anything, but "start" seems to make sense.

<sup><a id="fn.3" class="footnum" href="#fnr.3">3</a></sup> Vim-plug uses the `~/.config/nvim/plugged` directory by default, but passing a different path to `plug#begin()` overwrites the plugin directory.

<sup><a id="fn.4" class="footnum" href="#fnr.4">4</a></sup> Polyglot should have all languages you need. For language packs that aren't yet included, add them by sending a pull request. For example, [this pull request](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot/pull/655) adds support for [Gleam](https://gleam.run) through [gleam.vim.](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam.vim)
